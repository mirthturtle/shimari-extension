A Chrome Extension for [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) training. Extends [Shimari Go Discipline](https://mirthturtle.com/shimari) to modify your [OGS](https://online-go.com/) experience.


## Features

- **NEW!** Speed-limiter tool prevents you from playing too quickly
- Discipline blockers: Stops you from starting a new game unless you've:
  - reviewed your last game on [Shimari](https://mirthturtle.com/shimari)
  - recently done a [Pre-game Focus](https://mirthturtle.com/go/pregame)
- Tag moves to review later as you play
- Game Over effects: More visually stunning wins and losses. Great for streamers!


## Installation

Installing browser extensions is generally unwise from a security perspective, so Shimari Extension remains open source to allow you to audit the code before installing manually.

- Download or clone this repo
- Open your Chrome Extensions panel (chrome://extensions/) and turn on Developer Mode
- Click "Load Unpacked" and select the downloaded `shimari-extension` folder.


## Usage

After installation, this extension will automatically take effect on OGS.

- To use the discipline blockers, make sure you're logged into Shimari in your browser session.
- To tag moves during play, ensure you've set up an OGS integration for the account you're playing with.

Enable or disable specific features in your [settings](https://mirthturtle.com/go/settings).
