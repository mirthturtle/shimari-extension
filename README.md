A Chrome Extension for [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) training. Extends [Shimari Go Discipline](https://mirthturtle.com/shimari) to modify your [OGS](https://online-go.com/) experience.


## Features

- Discipline helpers: Blocks you from starting a new game unless you've:
  - reviewed your last game on [Shimari](https://mirthturtle.com/shimari)
  - recently done a [Pre-game Focus](https://mirthturtle.com/go/pregame)
- Gameover effects: More visually stunning wins and losses. Great for streamers!
- Adds mousewheel scrolling on games


## Installation

Installing browser extensions is generally unwise from a security perspective, so Shimari Extension remains open source to allow you to audit the code before installing manually.

- Download or clone this repo
- Open your Chrome Extensions panel (chrome://extensions/) and turn on Developer Mode
- Click "Load Unpacked" and select the downloaded `shimari-extension` folder.


## Usage

After installation, this extension will automatically provide OGS with the above features. The discipline blockers will only work if you're logged into Shimari in your browser session. From there, you can enable or disable specific features in your [settings](https://mirthturtle.com/go/settings).
